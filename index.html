			<h3>Description and Feature List</h3>
			<p>
				This will be a small open data application using Ottawa's open data sets. It will display Sledding Hills (2010) in the Ottawa region. The public 
				areas will consist of a map screen that displays all the places from the data set, as well as a single screen that describes each specific location. 
				There will also be an admin page that is password protected. In the admin page, you will be able add, edit, and delete places. On the map screen, users
				will be able to search their location for the closest locations to them, as well as filter them alphabetically or by rating. On the single screen, there
				will be Disqus comments, a way to rate the location, and the distance from the user's current location.

			<h3>Typical User (or User Persona)</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>Madison</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Madison is a 35 year old stay-at-home Mom with two small children. She's constantly looking for ways to occupy them as they are very active children 
				and love to get outside in play. She would use the app to find sledding hills she could take the kids out to to burn some of that energy. She is not
				overly technical, but understands how to use most applications and is quite savvy.
